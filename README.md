### **Teeko**

Teeko is a strategic board game that blends elements of tic-tac-toe and Connect Four, but with a twist. It was invented by John Scarne in 1952 and has since become a beloved classic.
### **Gameplay**

The game is played on a 5x5 grid. Each player has four pieces of their own color. The objective is to align your four pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Players take turns placing or moving pieces on the board. The catch is that once all pieces are placed, players can choose to move any of their pieces to an adjacent empty space on the board.

### **Setup**

The repository includes "1.png", "2.png", and "3.png". 

These all represent the possibility of cells, being empty, black piece, or blue piece. 

These should be kept in a seperate folder titled "img" in the same space that you plan to run Teeko.py.
